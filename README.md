# fiftydresses-squarespace

This is a custom implementation of a squarespace site, using the Squarespace's 
developer mode.

Since Squarespace has very limited documentation about using the 
developer mode, I've made this project public so hopefully it save other 
people some time in figuring things out!

[You can see this project in the wild here](https://tess-vigil.squarespace.com/)

This project uses custom templates ("layouts" and "blocks"), custom data types 
("customTypes" and "collections"), custom queries ("squarespace:query"), 
and custom CSS/JS.

The only other useful documentation I've found on the using Squarespace's 
development mode is Instrument's case study ["Creating a Clean Custom Maintable 
Site with Squarespace"](http://www.instrument.com/latest/creating-a-clean-custom-maintainable-site-with-squarespace)
